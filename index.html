            For those that like to golf, a golf resort is an excellent choice. These resorts will often have packages that include a night's stay along with a round of golf.

        <p>An island resort is perfect for those that want a getaway on an island surrounded by the ocean. In addition to providing most everything travelers need, these resorts also provide water activities such as scuba diving and water sports.

          The Peter Island Resort in the British Virgin Islands is an example of an island resort. This resort has access to 5 beaches and provides water activities such as boating, deep-sea fishing, snorkeling, and even swimming with dolphins.
          
          For travelers that like the water, but want a smaller body of water than the ocean, there are lake resorts. A lake resort is quieter than island or beach resorts and offers more nature activities such as hiking and fishing.</p>
